# Arkanoid
The game **Arkanoid**, developed by Taito in 1986, was based on the game mechanics of arcade machines **Breakout**, produced from 1976 to 1982 by Atari, and was timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of **Breakout**.

**Breakout**, in turn, took as a basis the arcade game **Pong** of 1972, where two players had to control a racket. To score as many points as possible, it was necessary not to miss the ball. The player who scored 11 points first won.

**Breakout** turned **Pong** into a single-player game where a player used a racket and a ball to break bricks. The player had to control one racket moving horizontally along the base of the screen, directing the ball up to break the bricks at the top of the screen. Every time he hit a brick, he disappeared before hitting the ball back in the direction of the racket, it was like an inverted version of hitting a tennis ball on the opposite wall.

A slight rethinking of the concept of **Pong**, which turned the game into a single-player, has become the cornerstone of all abstract sports games. Emphasis was placed on the need to determine the angles to get rid of the remaining bricks, and the need to destroy rows of objects can be found in the game **Space Invaders** 1978 and later games. Clones and variations of the **Breakout** idea can be found in many modern games.

**Arkanoid** was a continuation of the classic game **Breakout**, adding a number of improvements to it. So, from some of the broken bricks, prizes now fell out, with the help of which it was possible to improve (or worsen) a racket or a ball. A fire mode was added, when when a corresponding improvement was caught, it was possible to simply shoot at bricks without launching the ball. Another of the improvements was the introduction of a level system, each level with its own unique map. And at the last 33rd level, the player was waiting for a boss battle (a clear influence of **Space Invaders**). After that, the game returned to the first level, but at an accelerated pace.

Since **Arkanoid** is based on **Breakout**, let's look at the game mechanics of the latter in more detail.

Being the last game released by Atari before the industry switched to using microprocessors, **Breakout** was in a sense the last game of the first generation of gaming equipment. As a result, the first version of the game (slot machine) in 1976 was something cumbersome, and all the automation of processes was reduced to the use of transistors and triggers. Already with the transition to microprocessors in 1978, the use of programming languages (mainly assembly languages) began.
